# NOTE: This workflow only directly installs "hard" dependencies, i.e. Depends,
# Imports, and LinkingTo dependencies. Notably, Suggests dependencies are never
# installed, with the exception of testthat, knitr, and rmarkdown. The cache is
# never used to avoid accidentally restoring a cache containing a suggested
# dependency.
