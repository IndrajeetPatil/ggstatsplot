# Getting help with ggstatsplot

Thanks for using ggstatsplot. Before filing an issue, there are a few places to
explore and pieces to put together to make the process as smooth as possible.

Start by making a minimal **repr**oducible **ex**ample using the
[reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) package. If you haven't heard of or used
reprex before, you're in for a treat! Seriously, reprex will make all of your
R-question-asking endeavors easier (which is a pretty insane ROI for the five to
ten minutes it'll take you to learn what it's all about). For additional reprex
pointers, check out the [Get help!](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/) section of
the tidyverse site.

Armed with your reprex, the next step is to figure out [where to
ask](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#where-to-ask).

  * If it's a question: start with
    [community.rstudio.com](https://community.rstudio.com/), and/or
    StackOverflow. There are more people there to answer questions.

  * If it's a bug: you're in the right place, file an issue.

  * If you're not sure: let the community help you figure it out! If your
    problem _is_ a bug or a feature request, you can easily return here and
    report it.

Before opening a new issue, be sure to [search issues and pull
requests](https://github.com/IndrajeetPatil/ggstatsplot/issues) to make sure the
bug hasn't been reported and/or already fixed in the development version. By
default, the search will be pre-populated with `is:issue is:open`. You can [edit
the
qualifiers](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests/)
(e.g. `is:pr`, `is:closed`) as needed. For example, you'd simply remove
`is:open` to search _all_ issues in the repo, open or closed.

If you _are_ in the right place, and need to file an issue, please review the
["File issues"](https://www.tidyverse.org/contribute/#issues) paragraph from the
tidyverse contributing guidelines.

Thanks for your help!
