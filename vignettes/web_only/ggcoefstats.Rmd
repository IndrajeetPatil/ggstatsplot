The function `ggstatsplot::ggcoefstats` generates **dot-and-whisker plots** for
regression models saved in tidy data frames (produced with the `broom` package
and its mixed-effects modeling variant `broom.mixed` package).

By default, the plot displays `95%` confidence intervals for the regression
coefficients. The function currently supports only those classes of object that
are supported by the `broom` package. For an exhaustive list, see-
<https://broom.tidyverse.org/articles/available-methods.html>

In this vignette, we will see examples of how to use this function. We will try
to cover as many classes of objects as possible. Unfortunately, there is no
single dataset that will be helpful for carrying out all types of regression
analyses and, therefore, we will use various datasets to explore data-specific
hypotheses using regression models.

**Note before**: The following demo uses the pipe operator (`%>%`), so in case
  you are not familiar with this operator, here is a good explanation:
  <http://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html>

## General structure of the plots

Although the statistical models displayed in the plot may differ based on the
class of models being investigated, there are few aspects of the plot that will
be invariant across models:

- The dot-whisker plot contains a dot representing the **estimate** and their
**confidence intervals** (`95%` is the default). The estimate can either be
  effect sizes (for tests that depend on the `F` statistic) or regression
  coefficients (for tests with `t` and `z` statistic), etc. The function will, by
  default, display a helpful `x`-axis label that should clear up what estimates are
  being displayed. The confidence intervals can sometimes be asymmetric if
  bootstrapping was used.
  
- The caption will always contain diagnostic information, if available, about
  models that can be useful for model selection: The smaller the Akaike's
  Information Criterion (**AIC**) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (**BIC**)
  values, the "better" the model is. Additionally, the higher the
**log-likelihood** value the "better" is the model fit.

- The output of this function will be a `ggplot2` object and, thus, it can be
  further modified (e.g., change themes, etc.) with `ggplot2` functions.

In the following examples, we will try out a number of regression models and,
additionally, we will also see how we can change different aspects of the plot
itself.

## omnibus ANOVA (`aov`)

For this analysis, let's use the `movies_long` dataset, which provides
information about IMDB ratings, budget, length, MPAA ratings (R-rated,
PG, or PG-13), and genre for a number of movies. Let's say our hypothesis
is that the IMDB ratings for a movie are predicted by a multiplicative effect of
the genre and the MPAA rating it got. Let's carry out an omnibus
ANOVA to see if this is the case.

```{r aov1, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 8}
# loading needed libraries
library(ggstatsplot)
library(ggplot2)

# for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# to speed up the calculation, let's use only 10% of the data
movies_10 <- dplyr::sample_frac(tbl = ggstatsplot::movies_long, size = 0.1)

# plot
ggstatsplot::ggcoefstats(
  x = stats::aov(
    formula = rating ~ mpaa * genre,
    data = movies_10
  ),
  effsize = "eta", # changing the effect size estimate being displayed
  partial = FALSE, # just eta-squared
  point.color = "red", # changing the point color
  point.size = 4, # changing the point size
  point.shape = 15, # changing the point shape
  package = "dutchmasters", # package from which color paletter is to be taken
  palette = "milkmaid", # color palette for labels
  title = "omnibus ANOVA" # title for the plot
) +
  # further modification with the ggplot2 commands
  # note the order in which the labels are entered
  ggplot2::scale_y_discrete(labels = c("MPAA", "Genre", "Interaction term")) +
  ggplot2::labs(
    x = "effect size estimate (partial omega-squared)",
    y = NULL
  )
```

As this plot shows, there is no interaction effect between these two factors.

Note that we can also use this function for model selection. You can try out
different models with the code below and see how the AIC, BIC, and
log-likelihood values change. Looking at the model diagnostics, you should be
able to see that the model with only `genre` as the predictor of ratings seems
to perform almost equally well as more complicated additive and multiplicative
models. Although there is certainly some improvement with additive and
multiplicative models, it is by no means convincing enough for us to abandon a
simpler model.

```{r aov2, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 10, fig.width = 10}
library(ggstatsplot)

# to speed up the calculation, let's use only 10% of the data
movies_10 <- dplyr::sample_frac(tbl = ggstatsplot::movies_long, size = 0.1)

# for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# plot
ggstatsplot::combine_plots(
  # model 1
  ggstatsplot::ggcoefstats(
    x = stats::aov(
      formula = rating ~ mpaa,
      data = movies_10
    ),
    stats.label.color = "black",
    title = "1. Only MPAA ratings"
  ),
  ggstatsplot::ggcoefstats(
    x = stats::aov(
      formula = rating ~ genre,
      data = movies_10
    ),
    stats.label.color = "black",
    title = "2. Only genre"
  ),
  ggstatsplot::ggcoefstats(
    x = stats::aov(
      formula = rating ~ mpaa + genre,
      data = movies_10
    ),
    stats.label.color = "black",
    title = "3. Additive effect of MPAA and genre"
  ),
  ggstatsplot::ggcoefstats(
    x = stats::aov(
      formula = rating ~ mpaa * genre,
      data = movies_10
    ),
    stats.label.color = "black",
    title = "4. Multiplicative effect of MPAA and genre"
  ),
  title.text = "Model selection using ggcoefstats",
  labels = c("(a)", "(b)", "(c)", "(d)")
)
```

## omnibus ANOVA (`anova`)

You can also use `car` package to run an omnibus ANOVA:

```{r anova1, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 8}
# dataset will be used from `car` package
library(car)

# creating a model
mod <- stats::lm(
  formula = conformity ~ fcategory * partner.status,
  data = Moore,
  contrasts = list(fcategory = contr.sum, partner.status = contr.sum)
)

# plotting estimates
ggstatsplot::ggcoefstats(
  x = car::Anova(mod, type = "III"),
  title = "analysis of variance (`car` package)"
)
```

## linear model (`lm`)

Now that we have figured out that the movie's `genre` explains a fair amount of
the variation in how people rate the movie on IMDB, let's run a linear
regression model to see how different types of genres compare with each other
using **Action** movies as our comparison point.

```{r lm, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 8}
# plot
ggstatsplot::ggcoefstats(
  x = stats::lm(
    formula = rating ~ genre,
    data = dplyr::filter(
      .data = ggstatsplot::movies_long,
      genre %in% c(
        "Action",
        "Action Comedy",
        "Action Drama",
        "Comedy",
        "Drama",
        "Comedy Drama"
      )
    )
  ),
  conf.level = 0.99, # changing the confidence levels for confidence intervals
  sort = "ascending", # sorting the terms of the model based on estimate values
  label.direction = "both", # direction in which to adjust position of labels (both x and y)
  ggtheme = ggplot2::theme_gray(), # changing the default theme
  stats.label.color = c("#CC79A7", "darkgreen", "#0072B2", "black", "red"),
  title = "Movie ratings by their genre",
  subtitle = "Source: www.imdb.com"
) +
  # further modification with the ggplot2 commands
  # note the order in which the labels are entered
  ggplot2::scale_y_discrete(labels = c("Comedy", "Action Comedy", "Action Drama", "Comedy Drama", "Drama")) +
  ggplot2::labs(y = "Genre compared to Action movies)") +
  ggplot2::theme(axis.title.y = ggplot2::element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"))
```

As can be seen from the regression coefficients, compared to action movies, comedies and action comedies are not rated significantly better. All three of the "drama" types (pure, action or comedy dramas) have statistical significantly higher regression coefficients.  This finding occurs even with our more conservative  `0.99` confidence interval.

## linear mixed-effects model (`lmer`/`lmerMod`)

Now let's say we want to see how movie's budget relates to how good the movie is
rated to be on IMDB (e.g., more money, better ratings?). But we have reasons to
believe that the relationship between these two variables might be different for
different genres (e.g., budget might be a good predictor of how good the movie
is rated to be for animations or actions movies as more money can help with
better visual effects and animations, but this may not be true for dramas, so we
don't want to use `stats::lm`. In this case, therefore, we will be running a
linear mixed-effects model (using `lme4::lmer` and *p*-values generated using
the `sjstats::p_values` function) with a random slope for the genre variable.

```{r lmer1, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 12, fig.width = 7}
# set up
library(lme4)
library(ggstatsplot)
set.seed(123)

# to speed up the calculation, let's use only 10% of the data
movies_10 <- dplyr::sample_frac(tbl = ggstatsplot::movies_long, size = 0.1)

# combining the two different plots
ggstatsplot::combine_plots(
  # model 1: simple linear model
  ggstatsplot::ggcoefstats(
    x = stats::lm(
      formula = scale(rating) ~ scale(budget),
      data = movies_10
    ),
    title = "linear model",
    stats.label.color = "black",
    exclude.intercept = FALSE # show the intercept
  ) +
    ggplot2::labs(x = parse(text = "'standardized regression coefficient' ~italic(beta)")),
  # model 2: linear mixed-effects model
  ggstatsplot::ggcoefstats(
    x = lme4::lmer(
      formula = scale(rating) ~ scale(budget) + (budget | genre),
      data = movies_10,
      control = lme4::lmerControl(calc.derivs = FALSE)
    ),
    p.kr = FALSE,
    title = "linear mixed-effects model",
    stats.label.color = "black",
    exclude.intercept = FALSE # show the intercept
  ) +
    ggplot2::labs(
      x = parse(text = "'standardized regression coefficient' ~italic(beta)"),
      y = "fixed effects"
    ),
  labels = c("(a)", "(b)"),
  nrow = 2,
  ncol = 1,
  title.text = "Relationship between movie budget and its IMDB rating"
)
```

As can be seen from these plots, although there seems to be a really small
correlation between budget and rating in a linear model, this effect is not
significant once we take into account the hierarchical structure of the data.

Note that for mixed-effects models, only the *fixed* effects are shown because
there are no confidence intervals for *random* effects terms. In case, you would
like to see these terms, you can enter the same object you entered as `x`
argument to `ggcoefstats` in `broom::tidy`:

```{r lmer2, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
set.seed(123)

# to speed up the calculation, let's use only 10% of the data
movies_10 <- dplyr::sample_frac(tbl = ggstatsplot::movies_long, size = 0.1)

# tidy output
broom.mixed::tidy(
  x = lme4::lmer(
    formula = scale(rating) ~ scale(budget) + (budget | genre),
    data = movies_10,
    control = lme4::lmerControl(calc.derivs = FALSE)
  ),
  conf.int = TRUE,
  conf.level = 0.95
)
```

## robust linear mixed-effects models (`rlmer`)

Robust version of `lmer` (as implemented in `robustlmm` package) is also
supported-

```{r rlmer, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
set.seed(123)
library(robustlmm)

# model
roblmm.mod <- robustlmm::rlmer(
  formula = scale(Reaction) ~ scale(Days) + (Days | Subject),
  data = sleepstudy,
  rho.sigma.e = psi2propII(smoothPsi, k = 2.28),
  rho.sigma.b = chgDefaults(smoothPsi, k = 5.11, s = 10)
)

# plot
ggstatsplot::ggcoefstats(
  x = roblmm.mod,
  title = "robust estimation of linear mixed-effects model"
)
```

## non-linear mixed-effects model (`nlmer`/`nlmerMod`)

```{r nlmer, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 6}
# model
library(lme4)
set.seed(123)
startvec <- c(Asym = 200, xmid = 725, scal = 350)
nm1 <- lme4::nlmer(circumference ~ SSlogis(age, Asym, xmid, scal) ~ Asym | Tree,
  Orange,
  start = startvec
)

# plot
ggstatsplot::ggcoefstats(
  x = nm1,
  title = "non-linear mixed-effects model"
)
```

## non-linear least-squares model (`nls`)

So far we have been assuming a linear relationship between movie budget and
rating. But what if we want to also explore the possibility of a non-linear
relationship? In that case, we can run a non-linear least squares regression.
Note that you need to choose some non-linear function, which will be based on
prior exploratory data analysis (`y ~ k/x + c` implemented here, but you can try
out other non-linear functions, e.g. `Y ~ k * exp(-b*c)`).

```{r nls, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 6}
library(ggstatsplot)

# to speed up the calculation, let's use only 10% of the data
movies_10 <- dplyr::sample_frac(tbl = ggstatsplot::movies_long, size = 0.1)

# plot
ggstatsplot::ggcoefstats(
  x = stats::nls(
    formula = rating ~ k / budget + c, # try toying around with the form of non-linear function
    data = movies_10,
    start = list(k = 1, c = 0)
  ),
  title = "non-linear least squares regression",
  subtitle = "Non-linear relationship between budget and rating"
)
```

This analysis shows that there is indeed a possible non-linear association
between rating and budget (non-linear regression term `k` is significant), at
least with the particular non-linear function we used.

## generalized linear model (`glm`)

In all the analyses carried out thus far, the outcome variable (`y` in `y ~ x`)
has been continuous. In case the outcome variable is nominal/categorical/factor,
we can use the **generalized** form of linear model that works even if the
response is a numeric vector or a factor vector, etc.

To explore this model, we will use the Titanic dataset, which tabulates
information on the fate of passengers on the fatal maiden voyage of the ocean
liner *Titanic*, summarized according to economic status (class), sex, age, and
survival. Let's say we want to know what was the strongest predictor of whether
someone survived the Titanic disaster-

```{r glm1, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 6}
library(ggstatsplot)

# having a look at the Titanic dataset
df <- as.data.frame(x = Titanic)
str(df)

# plot
ggstatsplot::ggcoefstats(
  x = stats::glm(
    formula = Survived ~ Sex + Age,
    data = df,
    weights = df$Freq, # vector containing weights (no. of observations per row)
    family = stats::binomial(link = "logit") # choosing the family
  ),
  exponentiate = TRUE,
  ggtheme = ggthemes::theme_economist_white(),
  title = "generalized linear model (glm)",
  vline.color = "red",
  vline.linetype = "solid",
  label.segment.color = "red",
  stats.label.size = 3.5,
  stats.label.color = c(
    "orangered",
    "dodgerblue"
  )
)
```

As can be seen from the regression coefficients, all entered predictors were
significant predictors of the outcome. More specifically, being a female was
associated with higher likelihood of survival (compared to male). On other hand,
being an adult was associated with decreased likelihood of survival (compared to
child).

**Note**: Few things to keep in mind for `glm` models,

  - The exact statistic will depend on the family used. Below we will see
  a host of different function calls to `glm` with a variety of different
  families.
  
  - Some families will have a `t` statistic associated with them,
  while others a `z` statistic. The function will figure this out for you.

```{r glm2, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 13, fig.width = 10}
# creating dataframes to use for regression analyses
library(ggstatsplot)

# dataframe #1
(
  df.counts <-
    base::data.frame(
      treatment = gl(n = 3, k = 3, length = 9),
      outcome = gl(n = 3, k = 1, length = 9),
      counts = c(18, 17, 15, 20, 10, 20, 25, 13, 12)
    ) %>%
    tibble::as_tibble(x = .)
)

  lot1 = c(118, 58, 42, 35, 27, 25, 21, 19, 18),
  lot2 = c(69, 35, 26, 21, 18, 16, 13, 12, 12)
) %>%
  tibble::as_tibble(x = .))

# dataframe #3
x1 <- stats::rnorm(50)
y1 <- stats::rpois(n = 50, lambda = exp(1 + x1))

)

# combining all plots in a single plot

    ),

    stats.label.color = "black"
  ),
  # Family: Quasi
  ggstatsplot::ggcoefstats(
    x = stats::glm(
      formula = y ~ x,
      family = quasi(variance = "mu", link = "log"),
      data = df.3
    ),

  ncol = 2,
  title.text = "Exploring models with different `glm` families",
  title.color = "blue"
)
```

## generalized linear mixed-effects model (`glmer`/`glmerMod`)

In the previous example, we saw how being a female and being a child was
predictive of surviving the Titanic disaster. But in that analysis, we didn't
take into account one important factor: the passenger class in which people were
traveling. Naively, we have reasons to believe that the effects of sex and age
might be dependent on the class (maybe rescuing passengers in the first class
were given priority?). To take into account this hierarchical structure of the
data, we can run generalized linear mixed effects model with a random slope for
class.

```{r glmer, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 6}
# plot
ggstatsplot::ggcoefstats(
  x = lme4::glmer(
    formula = Survived ~ Sex + Age + (Sex + Age | Class),
    # select 20% of the sample to reduce the time of execution
    data = dplyr::sample_frac(tbl = ggstatsplot::Titanic_full, size = 0.2),
    family = stats::binomial(link = "logit"),
    control = lme4::glmerControl(
      optimizer = "Nelder_Mead",
      calc.derivs = FALSE,
      boundary.tol = 1e-7
    )
  ),
  title = "generalized linear mixed-effects model",
  exponentiate = TRUE,
  stats.label.color = "black"
)
```

As we had expected, once we take into account the differential relationship that
might exist between survival and predictors across different passenger classes,
only the sex factor remain a significant predictor. In other words, being a
female was the strongest predictor of whether someone survived the tragedy that
befell the Titanic.

## generalized linear mixed models using Template Model Builder (`glmmTMB`)

`glmmTMB` package allows for flexibly fitting generalized linear mixed models
(GLMMs) and extensions. Model objects from this package are also supported.

```{r glmmTMB, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 6}
# set up
library(glmmTMB)
library(lme4)
set.seed(123)

# model
mod <-
  glmmTMB::glmmTMB(
    formula = Reaction ~ Days + (Days | Subject),
    data = sleepstudy,
    family = glmmTMB::truncated_poisson()
  )

# plotting the model
ggstatsplot::ggcoefstats(
  x = mod,
  conf.method = "uniroot",
  title = "generalized linear mixed models \nusing Template Model Builder"
)
```

## generalized linear mixed models using AD Model Builder (`glmmadmb`)

Another option is to use `glmmadmb` package.

```{r glmmadmb, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 5}
# setup
library(glmmADMB)
set.seed(123)

# simulate values
set.seed(101)
d <- data.frame(f = factor(rep(LETTERS[1:10], each = 10)), x = runif(100))
u <- rnorm(10, sd = 2)
d$eta <- with(d, u[f] + 1 + 4 * x)
pz <- 0.3
zi <- rbinom(100, size = 1, prob = pz)
d$y <- ifelse(zi, 0, rpois(100, lambda = exp(d$eta)))

# fit
zipmodel <-
  glmmADMB::glmmadmb(
    formula = y ~ x + (1 | f),
    data = d,
    family = "poisson",
    zeroInflation = TRUE
  )

# plotting the model
ggstatsplot::ggcoefstats(
  x = zipmodel,
  title = "generalized linear mixed models \nusing AD Model Builder"
)
```

## cumulative link models (`clm`)

So far we have dealt either with continuous or nominal/factor responses (or
output variables), but sometimes we will encounter **ordinal** data (e.g.,
Likert scale measurement in behavioral sciences). In these cases, ordinal
regression models are more suitable. To study these models, we will use
`intent_morality` dataset included in the `ggstatsplot` package. This dataset
contains moral judgments ("how wrong was this behavior?", "how much punishment
does the agent deserve?"; on a Likert scale of 1-7) by participants about
third-party actors who harmed someone. There are four different conditions
formed out of belief (neutral, negative) and outcome (neutral, negative) for
four different vignettes, each featuring a different type of harm. The question
we are interested in is what explains variation in participants' rating:
information about intentionality, consequences, or their interaction?

```{r clm, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 6}
# for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# to speed up calculations, we will use just 10% of the dataset
ggstatsplot::ggcoefstats(
  x = ordinal::clm(
    formula = as.factor(rating) ~ belief * outcome,
    link = "logit",
    data = dplyr::sample_frac(tbl = ggstatsplot::intent_morality, size = 0.10),
    control = ordinal::clm.control(
      maxIter = 50,
      convergence = "silent"
    )
  ),
  stats.label.color = "black",
  title = "cumulative link model (clm)",
  subtitle = "(using `ordinal` package)",
  caption.summary = FALSE # suppress model diagnostics
) +
  ggplot2::labs(
    x = "logit regression coefficient",
    y = NULL
  )
```

As can be seen from this plot, both factors (intentionality and consequences)
were significant, and so was their interaction.

## cumulative link mixed models (`clmm`)

In the previous analysis, we carried out a single ordinal regression models to
see the effects intent and outcome information on moral judgments. But what if
we also want to account for item level differences (since different items had
different types of harm)? For this, we can use ordinal mixed-effects regression
model (with random effects for type of harm) to see how intent and outcome
contribute towards variation in moral judgment ratings-

```{r clmm1, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 6}
# for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# to speed up calculations, we will use just 10% of the dataset
ggstatsplot::ggcoefstats(
  x = ordinal::clmm(
    formula = as.factor(rating) ~ belief * outcome + (belief + outcome |
      harm),
    data = dplyr::sample_frac(tbl = ggstatsplot::intent_morality, size = 0.10),
    control = ordinal::clmm.control(
      method = "nlminb",
      maxIter = 50,
      gradTol = 1e-4,
      innerCtrl = "noWarn"
    )
  ),
  title = "cumulative link mixed model (clmm)",
  subtitle = "(using `ordinal` package)"
) +
  ggplot2::labs(
    x = "coefficient from ordinal mixed-effects regression",
    y = "fixed effects"
  )
```

Mixed effects regression didn't reveal any interaction effect. That is, most of
the variance was accounted for by the information about whether there was
harmful intent and whether there was harm, at least this is the effect we found
with these four types of (minor) harms.

Note that, by default, `beta` parameters are shown for `clm` and `clmm` models,
but you can also plot either just `alpha` or `both` using `ggcoefstats`.

```{r clmm2, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 6}
# for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# to speed up calculations, we will use just 10% of the dataset
ggstatsplot::ggcoefstats(
  x = ordinal::clmm(
    formula = as.factor(rating) ~ belief * outcome + (belief + outcome |
      harm),
    link = "logit",
    data = dplyr::sample_frac(tbl = ggstatsplot::intent_morality, size = 0.10),
    control = ordinal::clmm.control(
      maxIter = 50,
      gradTol = 1e-4,
      innerCtrl = "noWarn"
    )
  )
) +
  ggplot2::labs(
    x = "logit regression coefficients",
    y = "threshold parameters",
    title = "cumulative link mixed models"
  )
```

# polr model
set.seed(123)
library(MASS)
polr.mod <- MASS::polr(

data(api)

# preparing data
dclus1 <- survey::svydesign(
  id = ~dnum,
  weights = ~pw,
  data = apiclus1,
  fpc = ~fpc
)
dclus1 <-
  update(dclus1, mealcat = cut(meals, c(0, 25, 50, 75, 100)))

# model
m <- survey::svyolr(
  formula = mealcat ~ avg.ed + mobility + stype,
  design = dclus1
)

# plot
ggstatsplot::ggcoefstats(
  x = m,
  title = "proportional odds and related models",

)
```

## survey-weighted generalized linear models (`svyglm`)

```{r svyglm, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 5}
# data
library(survey)
set.seed(123)

    data = apistrat,
    fpc = ~fpc
  )

# model

  design = dstrat,
  family = quasibinomial()
)

# plot
ggstatsplot::ggcoefstats(
  x = mod,
  title = "survey-weighted generalized linear model"
)
```

## repeated measures ANOVA (`aovlist`)

Let's now consider an example of a repeated measures design where we want to run
omnibus ANOVA with a specific error structure. To carry out this analysis, we
will first have to convert the iris dataset from wide to long format such that
there is one column corresponding to `attribute` (which part of the calyx of a
flower is being measured: `sepal` or `petal`?) and one column corresponding to
`measure` used (`length` or `width`?). Note that this is within-subjects design
since the same flower has both measures for both attributes. The question we are
interested in is how much of the variance in measurements is explained by both
of these factors and their interaction.

```{r aovlist1, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 8}
# for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# having a look at iris before converting to long format
dplyr::glimpse(ggstatsplot::iris_long)

# let's use 20% of the sample to speed up the analysis
iris_long_20 <- dplyr::sample_frac(tbl = ggstatsplot::iris_long, size = 0.20)

# specifying the model (note the error structure)
ggstatsplot::ggcoefstats(
  x = stats::aov(
    formula = value ~ attribute * measure + Error(id / (attribute * measure)),
    data = iris_long_20
  ),
  effsize = "eta",
  partial = FALSE,
  nboot = 50,
  ggtheme = ggthemes::theme_fivethirtyeight(),
  ggstatsplot.layer = FALSE,
  stats.label.color = c("#0072B2", "#D55E00", "darkgreen"),
  title = "Variation in measurements for Iris species",
  subtitle = "Source: Iris data set (by Fisher or Anderson)",
  caption = "Results from 2 by 2 RM ANOVA"
) +
  ggplot2::theme(plot.subtitle = ggplot2::element_text(size = 11, face = "plain"))
```

As revealed by this analysis, all effects of this model are significant. But
most of the variance is explained by the `attribute`, with the next important
explanatory factor being the `measure` used. A very little amount of variation
in measurement is accounted for by the interaction between these two factors.

## robust regression (`lmRob`, `glmRob`)

The robust regression models, as implemented in the `robust` package are also
supported. 

```{r robust, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 12, fig.width = 8}
ggstatsplot::combine_plots(
  # plot 1: glmRob
  ggstatsplot::ggcoefstats(
    x = robust::glmRob(
      formula = Survived ~ Sex,
      data = dplyr::sample_frac(tbl = ggstatsplot::Titanic_full, size = 0.20),
      family = stats::binomial(link = "logit")
    ),
    title = "generalized robust linear model",
    package = "dichromat",
    palette = "BrowntoBlue.10",
    ggtheme = ggthemes::theme_fivethirtyeight(),
    ggstatsplot.layer = FALSE
  ),
  # plot 2: lmRob
  ggstatsplot::ggcoefstats(
    x = robust::lmRob(
      formula = Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width * Species,
      data = iris
    ),
    title = "robust linear model",
    package = "awtools",
    palette = "a_palette",
    ggtheme = ggthemes::theme_tufte(),
    ggstatsplot.layer = FALSE
  ),
  # arguments relevant for `combine_plots` function
  labels = c("(a)", "(b)"),
  title.text = "Robust variants of lmRob and glmRob",
  nrow = 2
)
```

## fit a linear model with multiple group fixed effects (`felm`)

Models of class `felm` from `lfe` package are also supported. This method is
used to fit linear models with multiple group fixed effects, similarly to `lm`.
It uses the Method of Alternating projections to sweep out multiple group
effects from the normal equations before estimating the remaining coefficients
with OLS.

```{r felm, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 5}
library(lfe)

# create covariates
x <- rnorm(1000)
x2 <- rnorm(length(x))

# individual and firm
id <- factor(sample(20, length(x), replace = TRUE))
firm <- factor(sample(13, length(x), replace = TRUE))

# effects for them
id.eff <- rnorm(nlevels(id))
firm.eff <- rnorm(nlevels(firm))

# left hand side
u <- rnorm(length(x))
y <- x + 0.5 * x2 + id.eff[id] + firm.eff[firm] + u

# estimate and print result
est <- lfe::felm(formula = y ~ x + x2 | id + firm)

# plot
ggstatsplot::ggcoefstats(
  x = est,
  title = "linear model with multiple group fixed effects"
)
```

## fit a GLM with lasso or elasticnet regularization (`glmnet`)

Although these models are not directly supported in `ggcoefstats` because of the

```

## dataframes (`tbl_df`, `tbl`, `data.frame`)

Sometimes you don't have a model object but a custom dataframe that you want
display using this function. If a data frame is to be plotted, it **must**
contain columns named `term` (names of predictors), and `estimate`
(corresponding estimates of coefficients or other quantities of interest). Other
optional columns are `conf.low` and `conf.high` (for confidence intervals), and
`p.value`. You will also have to specify the type of statistic relevant for
regression models (`"t"`, `"z"`, `"f"`) in case you want to display statistical
labels.

```{r dataframe, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 6}
# set up
set.seed(123)
library(ggstatsplot)
library(gapminder)

# data for running regression models
df <-
  dplyr::filter(.data = gapminder::gapminder, continent != "Oceania")

# saving results from regression
df_results <- purrr::pmap(
  .l = list(
    data = list(df),
    formula = list(scale(lifeExp) ~ scale(gdpPercap) + (gdpPercap |
      country)),
    grouping.vars = alist(continent),
    output = list("tidy", "glance")
  ),
  .f = groupedstats::grouped_lmer
) %>%
  dplyr::full_join(x = .[[1]], y = .[[2]], by = "continent")

# modifying the results so to be compatible with the `ggcoefstats` requirement
(df_results %<>%
  dplyr::filter(.data = ., term != "(Intercept)") %>%
  dplyr::select(
    .data = .,
    -effect,
    -term,
    term = continent,
    statistic = t.value
  ))

# plot
ggstatsplot::ggcoefstats(
  x = df_results,
  statistic = "t",
  sort = "ascending",
  title = "Relationship between life expectancy and GDP",
  subtitle = "Source: Gapminder foundation",
  caption = "Data from Oceania continent not included"
)
```

## meta-analysis

In case the estimates you are displaying come from multiple studies, you can
also use this function to carry out random-effects meta-analysis (as implemented
in the [metafor](http://www.metafor-project.org/doku.php) package; see
`metafor::rma()`).

The dataframe you enter **must** contain at the minimum the following three
columns- `term`, `estimate`, `std.error`.

```{r meta1, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 6}
# let's make up a dataframe (with minimum amount of details)
df_min <- tibble::tribble(
  ~term, ~estimate, ~std.error,
  "study1", 0.0665, -0.778,
  "study2", 0.542, -0.280,
  "study3", 0.045, 0.030,
  "study4", 0.500, -0.708,
  "study5", 0.032, -0.280,
  "study6", 0.085, 0.030
)

# plot
ggstatsplot::ggcoefstats(
  x = df_min,
  meta.analytic.effect = TRUE,
  point.color = "red"
)
```

Or you can also provide a dataframe containing all the other relevant
information for making labels with statistical information.

```{r meta2, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 7}
# let's make up a dataframe (with all available details)
df_full <- tibble::tribble(
  ~term, ~statistic, ~estimate, ~std.error, ~p.value, ~df.residual,
  "study1", 0.158, 0.0665, -0.778, 0.875, 5L,
  "study2", 1.33, 0.542, -0.280, 0.191, 10L,
  "study3", 1.24, 0.045, 0.030, 0.001, 12L,
  "study4", 0.156, 0.500, -0.708, 0.885, 8L,
  "study5", 0.33, 0.032, -0.280, 0.101, 2L,
  "study6", 1.04, 0.085, 0.030, 0.001, 3L
)

# plot
ggstatsplot::ggcoefstats(
  x = df_full,
  meta.analytic.effect = TRUE,
  statistic = "t",
  package = "LaCroixColoR",
  palette = "paired"
)
```

## And much more...

This vignette was supposed to give a comprehensive account of regression models
supported by `ggcoefstats`. The list of supported models will keep expanding as
additional tidiers are added to the `broom` and `broom.mixed` package:
<https://broom.tidyverse.org/articles/available-methods.html>

Note that not **all** models supported by `broom` will be supported by
`ggcoefstats`. In particular, classes of objects for which there is no column
for `estimate`s present (e.g., `kmeans`, `optim`, `muhaz`, `survdiff`, `zoo`,
etc.) are not supported.
