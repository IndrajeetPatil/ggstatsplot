## Graphic design principles

### Graphical perception
   
Graphical perception involves visual decoding of the encoded information in
graphs. `{ggstatsplot}` incorporates the paradigm proposed in ([@cleveland1985],
Chapter 4) to facilitate making visual judgments about quantitative information
effortless and almost instantaneous. Based on experiments, Cleveland proposes
that there are ten elementary graphical-perception tasks that we perform to
visually decode quantitative information in graphs (organized from most to least
accurate; [@cleveland1985], p.254)-

  * Position along a common scale

  * Position along identical, non-aligned scales

  * Length

  * Angle (Slope)

  * Area

  * Volume

  * Color hue

So the key principle of Cleveland's paradigm for data display is-

> "We should encode data on a graph so that the visual decoding involves
[graphical-perception] tasks as high in the ordering as possible."

For example, decoding the data point values in `ggbetweenstats` requires
position judgments along a common scale:

```{r}
#| label = "fig1",
#| fig.height = 9,
#| fig.width = 10,
#| fig.cap = "Note that assessing differences in mean values between groups has been made easier
#| with the help of \\textit{position} of data points along a common scale (the Y-axis) and
#| labels."
## for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

## plot
ggbetweenstats(
  data = dplyr::filter(
    movies_long,
    genre %in% c("Action", "Action Comedy", "Action Drama", "Comedy")
  ),
  x = genre,
  y = rating,
  title = "IMDB rating by film genre",
  xlab = "Genre",
  ylab = "IMDB rating (average)",
  outlier.tagging = TRUE,
  outlier.label = title
)
```

There are few instances where `{ggstatsplot}` diverges from recommendations made
in Cleveland's paradigm:

  - For the categorical/nominal data, `{ggstatsplot}` uses pie charts which rely
    on *angle* judgments, which are less accurate (as compared to bar graphs,
    e.g., which require *position* judgments). This shortcoming is assuaged to
    some degree by using plenty of labels that describe percentages for all
    slices. This makes angle judgment unnecessary and pre-vacates any concerns
    about inaccurate judgments about percentages. Additionally, it also provides
    alternative function to `ggpiestats` for working with categorical variables:
    `ggbarstats`.

```{r}
#| label = "fig2",
#| fig.height = 4,
#| fig.width = 10,
#| fig.cap = "Pie charts don't follow Cleveland's paradigm to data display because they rely on
#| less accurate angle judgments. `{ggstatsplot}` sidesteps this issue by always labelling
#| percentages for pie slices, which makes angle judgments unnecessary."
## for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

## plot
ggpiestats(
  data = movies_long,
  x = genre,
  y = mpaa,
  title = "Distribution of MPAA ratings by film genre",
  legend.title = "layout"
)
```

  - Cleveland's paradigm also emphasizes that *superposition* of data is better
    than *juxtaposition* ([@cleveland1985], p.201) because this allows for a
    more incisive comparison of the values from different parts of the dataset.
    This recommendation is violated in all `grouped_` variants of the function.
    Note that the range for Y-axes are no longer the same across juxtaposed
    subplots and so visually comparing the data becomes difficult. On the other
    hand, in the superposed plot, all data have the same range and coloring
    different parts makes the visual discrimination of different components of
    the data, and their comparison, easier. But the goal of `grouped_` variants
    of functions is to not only show different aspects of the data but also to
    run statistical tests and showing detailed results for all aspects of the
    data in a superposed plot is difficult. Therefore, this is a compromise
    `{ggstatsplot}` is comfortable with, at least to produce plots for quick
    exploration of different aspects of the data.

```{r}
#| label = "fig3",
#| fig.height = 12,
#| fig.width = 10,
#| fig.cap = "Comparing different aspects of data is much more accurate in (\\textit{a}) a
#| \\textit{superposed} plot, which is recommended in Cleveland's paradigm, than in (\\textit{b})
#| a \\textit{juxtaposed} plot, which is how it is implemented in `{ggstatsplot}` package. This is
#| because displaying detailed results from statistical tests would be difficult in a superposed
#| plot."
## for reproducibility
set.seed(123)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggstatsplot)

## creating a smaller data frame
df <- dplyr::filter(movies_long, genre %in% c("Comedy", "Drama"))

## plot
combine_plots(
  plotlist = list(
    ## plot 1: superposition
    ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = length, y = rating, color = genre)) +
      geom_jitter(size = 3, alpha = 0.5) +
      geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
      labs(title = "superposition (recommended in Cleveland's paradigm)") +
      theme_ggstatsplot(),
    ## plot 2: juxtaposition
    grouped_ggscatterstats(
      data = df,
      x = length,
      y = rating,
      grouping.var = genre,
      marginal = FALSE,
      annotation.args = list(title = "juxtaposition (`{ggstatsplot}` implementation in `grouped_` functions)")
    )
  ),
  ## combine for comparison
  annotation.args = list(title = "Two ways to compare different aspects of data"),
  plotgrid.args = list(nrow = 2)
)
```

The `grouped_` plots follow the *Shrink Principle* ([@tufte2001], p.166-7) for
high-information graphics, which dictates that the data density and the size of
the data matrix can be maximized to exploit maximum resolution of the available
data-display technology. Given the large maximum resolution afforded by most
computer monitors today, saving `grouped_` plots with appropriate resolution
ensures no loss in legibility with reduced graphics area.

### Graphical excellence
   
Graphical excellence consists of communicating complex ideas with clarity and in
a way that the viewer understands the greatest number of ideas in a short amount
of time all the while not quoting the data out of context. The package follows
the principles for *graphical integrity* [@tufte2001]:

  - The physical representation of numbers is proportional to the numerical
    quantities they represent. The plot show how means (in `ggbetweenstats`) or
    percentages (`ggpiestats`) are proportional to the vertical distance or the
    area, respectively).

  - All important events in the data have clear, detailed, and thorough labeling
    plot shows how `ggbetweenstats` labels means, sample size information,
    outliers, and pairwise comparisons; same can be appreciated for `ggpiestats`
    and `gghistostats` plots. Note that data labels in the data region are
    designed in a way that they don't interfere with our ability to assess the
    overall pattern of the data ([@cleveland1985];

p.44-45). This is achieved by using `ggrepel` package to place labels in a way
that reduces their visual prominence.

  - None of the plots have *design* variation (e.g., abrupt change in scales)
    over the surface of a same graphic because this can lead to a false
    impression about variation in *data*.

  - The number of information-carrying dimensions never exceed the number of
    dimensions in the data (e.g., using area to show one-dimensional data).

  - All plots are designed to have no **chartjunk** (like moirÃ© vibrations, fake
    perspective, dark grid lines, etc.) ([@tufte2001], Chapter 5).

There are some instances where `{ggstatsplot}` graphs don't follow principles of
clean graphics, as formulated in the Tufte theory of data graphics
([@tufte2001], Chapter 4). The theory has four key principles:

  1. Above all else show the data.

  2. Maximize the data-ink ratio.

  3. Erase non-data-ink.

  4. Erase redundant data-ink, within reason.

In particular, default plots in `{ggstatsplot}` can sometimes violate one of the
principles from 2-4. According to these principles, every bit of ink should have
reason for its inclusion in the graphic and should convey some new information
to the viewer. If not, such ink should be removed. One instance of this is
bilateral symmetry of data measures. For example, in the figure below, we can
see that both the box and violin plots are mirrored, which consumes twice the
space in the graphic without adding any new information. But this redundancy is
tolerated for the sake of beauty that such symmetrical shapes can bring to the
graphic. Even Tufte admits that efficiency is but one consideration in the
design of statistical graphics ([@tufte2001],

p. 137). Additionally, these principles were formulated in an era in which
   computer graphics had yet to revolutionize the ease with which graphics could
   be produced and thus some of the concerns about minimizing data-ink for
   easier production of graphics are not as relevant as they were.

### Statistical variation

One of the important functions of a plot is to show the variation in the data,
which comes in two forms:

  - **Measurement noise**: In `{ggstatsplot}`, the actual variation in
    measurements is shown by plotting a combination of (jittered) raw data
    points with a boxplot laid on top or a histogram. None of the plots, where
    empirical distribution of the data is concerned, show the sample standard
    deviation because they are poor at conveying information about limits of the
    sample and presence of outliers ([@cleveland1985], p.220).

```{r}
#| label = "fig5",
#| fig.height = 6,
#| fig.width = 8,
#| fig.cap = "Distribution of a variable shown using `gghistostats`."
## for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

## plot
gghistostats(
  data = morley,
  x = Speed,
  test.value = 792,
  xlab = "Speed of light (km/sec, with 299000 subtracted)",
  title = "Distribution of measured Speed of light",
  caption = "Note: Data collected across 5 experiments (20 measurements each)"
)
```

  - **Sample-to-sample statistic variation**: Although, traditionally, this
    variation has been shown using the standard error of the mean (SEM) of the
    statistic, `{ggstatsplot}` plots instead use 95% confidence intervals. This is
    because the interval formed by error bars correspond to a 68% confidence
    interval, which is not a particularly interesting interval
    ([@cleveland1985], p.222-225).

```{r}
#| label = "fig6",
#| fig.height = 5,
#| fig.width = 5,
#| fig.cap = "Sample-to-sample variation in regression estimates is displayed using confidence
#| intervals in `ggcoefstats`."
## for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

## creating model object
mod <- lme4::lmer(
  formula = total.fruits ~ nutrient + rack + (nutrient | gen),
  data = lme4::Arabidopsis
)

## plot
ggcoefstats(x = mod)
```

## Statistical analysis

### Data requirements

As an extension of `{ggplot2}`, `{ggstatsplot}` has the same expectations about the
structure of the data. More specifically,

  - The data should be organized following the principles of *tidy data*, which
    specify how statistical structure of a data frame (variables and
    observations) should be mapped to physical structure (columns and rows).
    More specifically, tidy data means all variables have their own columns and
    each row corresponds to a unique observation ([@wickhamTidyData2014]).

  - All `{ggstatsplot}` functions remove `NA`s from variables of interest (similar
    to `{ggplot2}`; [@wickham2016], p.207) in the data and display total sample
    size (*n*, either observations for between-subjects or pairs for
    within-subjects designs) in the subtitle to inform the user/reader about the
    number of observations included for both the statistical analysis and the
    visualization. But, when sample sizes differ *across* tests in the same
    function, `{ggstatsplot}` makes an effort to inform the user of this aspect.
    For example, `ggcorrmat` features several correlation test pairs and,
    depending on variables in a given pair, the sample sizes may vary.

```{r}
#| label = "fig4",
#| fig.height = 5,
#| fig.width = 10,
#| fig.cap = "`{ggstatsplot}` functions remove `NA`s from variables of interest and display total
#| sample size \\textit{n}, but they can give more nuanced information about sample sizes when
#| \\textit{n} differs across tests. For example, `ggcorrmat` will display (\\textit{a}) only one
#| total sample size once when no `NA`s present, but (\\textit{b}) will instead show minimum,
#| median, and maximum sample sizes across all correlation tests when `NA`s are present across
#| correlation variables."
## for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

## creating a new dataset without any NAs in variables of interest
msleep_no_na <-
  dplyr::filter(
    ggplot2::msleep,
    !is.na(sleep_rem), !is.na(awake), !is.na(brainwt), !is.na(bodywt)
  )

## variable names vector
var_names <- c("REM sleep", "time awake", "brain weight", "body weight")

## combining two plots using helper function in `{ggstatsplot}`
combine_plots(
  plotlist = purrr::pmap(
    .l = list(data = list(msleep_no_na, ggplot2::msleep)),
    .f = ggcorrmat,
    cor.vars = c(sleep_rem, awake:bodywt),
    cor.vars.names = var_names,
    colors = c("#B2182B", "white", "#4D4D4D"),
    title = "Correlalogram for mammals sleep dataset",
    subtitle = "sleep units: hours; weight units: kilograms"
  ),
  plotgrid.args = list(nrow = 1)
)
```

### Statistical reporting

But why would combining statistical analysis with data visualization be helpful?
We list few reasons below-

  - A recent survey [@nuijten2016] revealed that one in eight papers in major
    psychology journals contained a grossly inconsistent *p*-value that may have
    affected the statistical conclusion. `{ggstatsplot}` helps avoid such
    reporting errors: Since the plot and the statistical analysis are yoked
    together, the chances of making an error in reporting the results are
    minimized. One need not write the results manually or copy-paste them from a
    different statistics software program (like SPSS, SAS, and so on).

The default setting in `{ggstatsplot}` is to produce plots with statistical
details included. Most often than not, these results are displayed as a
`subtitle` in the plot. Great care has been taken into which details are
included in statistical reporting and why.

![Template for reporting statistical details](../../man/figures/stats_reporting_format.png)

APA guidelines [@apa2009] are followed by default while reporting statistical
details:

  - Percentages are displayed with no decimal places.

  - Correlations, *t*-tests, and $\chi^2$-tests are reported with the degrees of
    freedom in parentheses and the significance level.

  - ANOVAs are reported with two degrees of freedom and the significance level.

  - Regression results are presented with the unstandardized or standardized
    estimate (beta), whichever was specified by the user, along with the
    statistic (depending on the model, this can be a *t*, *F*, or *z* statistic)
    and the corresponding significance level.

  - With the exception of *p*-values, most statistics are rounded to two decimal
    places by default.

### Dealing with **null results**: 

All functions therefore by default return Bayesian in favor of the null
hypothesis by default. If the null hypothesis can't be rejected with the null
hypothesis significance testing (NHST) approach, the Bayesian approach can help
index evidence in favor of the null hypothesis (i.e., $BF_{01}$). By default,
natural logarithms are shown because Bayesian values can sometimes be pretty
large. Having values on logarithmic scale also makes it easy to compare evidence
in favor alternative ($BF_{10}$) versus null ($BF_{01}$) hypotheses (since
$log_{e}(BF_{01}) = - log_{e}(BF_{01})$).

###  Avoiding the **"p-value error"**:  

The *p*-value indexes the probability that the researchers have falsely rejected
a true null hypothesis (Type I error, i.e.) and can rarely be *exactly* 0. And
yet over 97,000 manuscripts on Google Scholar report the *p*-value to be `p
=0.000`, putatively due to relying on default computer software outputs
[@lilienfeld2015]. All *p*-values displayed in `{ggstatsplot}` plots avoid this
mistake. Anything less than `p < 0.001` is displayed as such. The package deems
it unimportant how infinitesimally small the *p*-values are and, instead, puts
emphasis on the effect size magnitudes and their 95% CIs.
