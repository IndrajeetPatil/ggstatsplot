# Introduction

One of the best resources to learn about functionality afforded by `{ggstatsplot}`
package is to read the dedicated
[website](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/). A lot of love and work
has gone into writing detailed function documentation and vignettes, and I will
highly recommend you check them out.

But, the website is certainly not the only resource available to learn about
this package, and below are some other resources that might be helpful for you
to learn about `{ggstatsplot}` package.
