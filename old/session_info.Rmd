# Session information

This vignette provides exhaustive details about the session (attached packages,
their versions, date, source, etc.) in which the vignettes were rendered and the
website was built. This is helpful information for reproducibility. If you see
any divergences between function behavior as described on the website and what
you see on your system, this information can come in handy for diagnosing the
source of those divergences.

This session information was generated on `r Sys.Date()`:

```{r}
#| label = "session_info"
# setup for the session
options(width = 200)

# for pretty printing of tibbles
options(tibble.width = Inf, pillar.bold = TRUE, pillar.subtle_num = TRUE)

library(ggstatsplot)

# session information
sessioninfo::session_info(include_base = TRUE)
```
